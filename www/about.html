        <h1> About </h1>
        <h2><a name="ourStory"></a>Our Story</h2>
        <p>I am honoured to have you read this. This is a tale of two sisters, Netondo and Mbaye.
        </p>

        <p>My sister, Netondo, and I both moved away from Kenya to attend university in foreign countries. As black women living in Japan and Canada, we struggled with finding hair products that worked for black hair. We had endless conversations on how frustrated we were with all products we came across. Until eventually, we decided to use our backgrounds in Chemical Engineering to formulate our own hair products.
        </p>

        <p>After several experiments with natural home created recipes, we finally ended up with a product iteration that created remarkable results for our hair. We then tested this product on our friends and family in Kenya. After receiving rave reviews, we started selling the product door to door in Kenya.
        </p>

        <p>Excited by the genuine interest we saw, my sister and I decided that I should take the opportunity to move to the USA where I had been admitted to the Cornell University’s MBA program. The goal is to gain business acumen while working to launch our deep conditioning product in the USA.
        </p>

        <p>We believe Liyanga can make more women love their natural curls.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="ourIngredients"></a>Our Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Simplicity is our goal.</strong></p>

        <p>Have you ever wondered why black hair products generally have the same ingredients as products that cater to non-black hair even though black hair is clearly very different from most hair types?</p>

        <p>We question this too, and it is because of this that we have formulated Liyanga.</p>

        <p>Our ingredients have been used in many African societies for generations. We hope you will benefit from them, too.</p>

            When it comes to hair, avocados really “shine." Historical evidence shows that as far back as early Egypt people used avocado to prevent hair loss and as a natural moisturizer. Avocado also makes hair shiny and supple.

            Coconut oil stimulates hair growth getting deep into its follicles. Its high concentration of fatty acids nourishes hair with protein that produces strong and long, soft and shiny hair. In addition to preventing dryness and dullness,
            coconut oil also reduces split ends, thinning and dandruff. Coconut oil therefore promotes scalp health, adds luster, shine and softness to the hair while preventing hair breakage and split ends, which therefore contributes to hair
            length.

            Native to South Sudan, our Shea butter contains a high fatty acid content, which makes it easy for it to penetrate hair. This helps reduce hair breakage. Additionally, our shea butter’s emollient properties help with keeping your hair
            moisturised.
