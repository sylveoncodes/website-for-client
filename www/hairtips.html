            <p>Hi everyone! I thought I’d share my go to protective style. I workout regularly so I find it easier to keep my hair in a protective style for most days of the week or month. My go to style is African threading. It’s fairly simple once
              you get the hang of it and also very economical (all you need is a ball of yarn).
            </p>

            <p><em>Prepping your hair:</em>
              Wash and condition your hair as needed. I use Castile soap to cleanse my hair and then I deep condition my hair for about five hours with Liyanga (you can opt to shorten the deep conditioning time to what works for you). I then rinse
              off the conditioner from my hair and oil my hair and scalp with a mixture of coconut oil and shea butter.
            </p>

            <p><em>Styling:</em>
              Cut out several pieces of yarn from your ball of yarn. I usually prefer to pre-cut the pieces I will need to style my hair. The length of each piece depends on the length and thickness of your hair as well as how big or small you want
              to section your hair . My pieces are usually around 70 cm long and I make around 90 pieces. Take three pieces of yarn and tie a knot at the end to make them as one single strand.
            </p>

            <p>Section your hair into four or more sections (as you prefer). Take one section and section off a chunk of hair (thickness depends on your preference). Detangle that chunk of hair and holding it with some tension (not too tight, just
              right without pulling on your scalp), take a strand of yarn and proceed to wrap it on the chunk of hair. When you reach the ends of your hair, fold ends of the hair and wrap closely with the yarn making sure not to expose the ends.
              Proceed to tie a knot and cut off any remaining piece of yarn.
            </p>

            <p>This style usually takes about an hour or more depending on your hair’s length and thickness as well as how adept you are at wrapping the yarn. This style can last up to four weeks. You can also play around with this style by using
              different colors of yarn.
            </p>

            <p>So how do you care for your braids, cornrows, twists, bantu knots, wraps and the like? As I mentioned earlier, I am fan of African Threading so I’ll tell you how I care for my yarn wraps.
            </p>

            <p>After a workout, I just hop into the shower and rinse off the sweat from my hair already wrapped in yarn. I rarely use soap for the cleansing of my scalp when I have on a protective style. I find plain warm water sufficient to get rid
              of the sweat and dirt. I may use soap two or more weeks into my protective style (but that’s quite rare). After my shower, I wring out the water from my threaded hair and wrap it in a towel to dry.
            </p>

            <p>By the time I’m done with dressing, my hair/ style is dry enough so I remove the towel and proceed to oil my scalp and the hair exposed to the air. I use coconut oil or a mix of coconut and sunflower oils. I proceed to hold my yarn
              wrapped hair in a bun or a ponytail.
            </p>

            <p>At night, I’ll sleep in a satin scarf or an old/running panty hose that is clean. I find sleeping with my hair covered in panty hose keeps my style neat over a long period of time.

          <p>Hello! Here is my first blogged wash day experience. This wash day, as in all my wash days, I try to keep things simple and fun. I believe using minimal hair products is key to a great wash day and to healthy, moisturised hair.</p>

          <h4>Tools</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Shampoo: Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Pure Soap</li>
            <li>Deep Conditioner: Liyanga</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>The Wash Day Experience</h4>

          <p><em>Cleansing:</em> I simply stepped into the shower then wet my hair before applying Dr Bronner’s peppermint soap to my hair. I then massaged my hair and scalp forming a fantastic lather. Once, I was done with this yumminess, I rinsed
            off the soap. Notice, there is no sectioning of hair, it is just plain and simple wetting, lathering and rinsing of all hair. No braiding and washing in sections.
          </p>

          <p><em>Deep Conditioning:</em> I then deep conditioned my hair with Liyanga for 2 hours. I rinsed off the product.
          </p>

          <p>My hair felt soft, moisturised, healthy, tangle-free and manageable.
          </p>

          <p>The same day and immediately after washing off Liyanga from my hair, I styled my hair into two-line braids. Good for the week. Love it when it is this simple.
          </p>
